SHSS - Single-Hop, single-satellite
	1 - Delay:         Low
	2 - Terminal size: Large + high power (*)
	3 - Earth segment: No earth segment (not vulnerable) (*)
	4 - Space segment: Limited power (cheaper)
	5 - Complexity:    Simple, because no interconnection and no handover (no ISL) (*)
	6 - Coverage:      Limited (*)

DHSS - Double-Hop, single-satellite
	1 - Delay:         Medium (x2)
	2 - Terminal size: Small + low power
	3 - Earth segment: Vulnerable, because if down entire network goes down (*)
	4 - Space segment: Limited power | cheaper, because power is provided by earth segment (*)
	5 - Complexity:    Simple, because no interconnection and no handover (no ISL) (*)
	6 - Coverage:      Limited (*)

MHMS - Multiple-Hop, multiple-satellite
	1 - Delay:         High
	2 - Terminal size: Small + low power (*)
	3 - Earth segment: Secure (*)
	4 - Space segment: Limited power | cheaper, because power is provided by earth segment (*)
	5 - Complexity:    Simple, because no interconnection and no handover (no ISL) (*)
	6 - Coverage:      Wide

SHMS - Single-Hop, multiple-satellite
	1 - Delay:         High (*)
	2 - Terminal size: Large + high power (*)
	3 - Earth segment: No earth segment (not vulnerable) (*)
	4 - Space segment: Requires power (expensive) (*)
	5 - Complexity:    Complex space segment, because requires interconnection and/or handover (has ISL)
	6 - Coverage:      Global
