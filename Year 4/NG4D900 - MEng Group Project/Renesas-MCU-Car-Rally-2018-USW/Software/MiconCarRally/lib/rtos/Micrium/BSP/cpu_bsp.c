*
* Description : Initialize & start CPU timestamp timer.
*
* Argument(s) : none.
*
* Return(s)   : none.
*
* Caller(s)   : CPU_TS_Init().
*
*               This function is an INTERNAL CPU module function & MUST be implemented by application/
*               BSP function(s) [see Note #1] but MUST NOT be called by application function(s).
*
* Note(s)     : (1) CPU_TS_TmrInit() is an application/BSP function that MUST be defined by the developer
*                   if either of the following CPU features is enabled :
*
*                   (a) CPU timestamps
*                   (b) CPU interrupts disabled time measurements
*
*                   See 'cpu_cfg.h  CPU TIMESTAMP CONFIGURATION  Note #1'
*                     & 'cpu_cfg.h  CPU INTERRUPTS DISABLED TIME MEASUREMENT CONFIGURATION  Note #1a'.
*
*               (2) (a) Timer count values MUST be returned via word-size-configurable 'CPU_TS_TMR'
*                       data type.
*
*                       (1) If timer has more bits, truncate timer values' higher-order bits greater
*                           than the configured 'CPU_TS_TMR' timestamp timer data type word size.
*
*                       (2) Since the timer MUST NOT have less bits than the configured 'CPU_TS_TMR'
*                           timestamp timer data type word size; 'CPU_CFG_TS_TMR_SIZE' MUST be
*                           configured so that ALL bits in 'CPU_TS_TMR' data type are significant.
*
*                           In other words, if timer size is not a binary-multiple of 8-bit octets
*                           (e.g. 20-bits or even 24-bits), then the next lower, binary-multiple
*                           octet word size SHOULD be configured (e.g. to 16-bits).  However, the
*                           minimum supported word size for CPU timestamp timers is 8-bits.
*
*                       See also 'cpu_cfg.h   CPU TIMESTAMP CONFIGURATION  Note #2'
*                              & 'cpu_core.h  CPU TIMESTAMP DATA TYPES     Note #1'.
*
*                   (b) Timer SHOULD be an 'up'  counter whose values increase with each time count.
*
*                   (c) When applicable, timer period SHOULD be less than the typical measured time
*                       but MUST be less than the maximum measured time; otherwise, timer resolution
*                       inadequate to measure desired times.
*
*                   See also 'CPU_TS_TmrRd()  Note #2'.
