This report will cover the first and last assignment for the module NG4S804 - Applied Digital Signal Processing on the topic of DFT and Frequency Analysis.\\

The two parts of this report challenge the student to develop a computer application written in the C Language in which a set of three different signals are to be processed and converted from the time domain into the frequency domain by the means of the DFT - Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm. These signals consist of a sine wave, a mix of three sine waves and a square wave.

\paragraph{}
Part one begins by giving context and briefly introducing the DFT algorithm. It then proceeds by applying the function to the three inputs using 256 points of resolution.\\

The second part of this report continues in the exact same manner, except the bin count will be increased from 256 to 512 points. The size of the input signals will also increase to 512 samples.
After this, a comparison and explanation will be made in regards to the effect of the bin count over the shape of the DFT output.\\

This same question is then followed by an attempt to further improve the output. In order to do this, a Hann window function will be applied on the input signals before passing them through the DFT algorithm.\\

Finally, in the topic of filtering and signal processing, two more windowing functions will be researched - the Welch and Gaussian windows.
